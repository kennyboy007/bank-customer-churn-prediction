## 🚀 Live App
**[Try the interactive predictor here](https://bank-customer-churn-prediction-uv2fyjroluyxf6kestdqyn.streamlit.app/)**

Enter a customer's details and get a live churn prediction, plus model insights (ROC-AUC, feature importance, classification report) — built with the exact XGBoost pipeline described below.

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest revenue risks in retail banking.
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn and translate model outputs into actionable retention strategies.

Rather than focusing only on accuracy, this project emphasizes:
- Class imbalance handling
- Model comparison
- ROC-AUC evaluation
- Threshold optimization
- Business interpretation of results

The objective is not just to predict churn — but to support smarter decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains 10,000 bank customers with features such as:
- Credit Score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Activity Status
- Estimated Salary
- Churn Status (Target Variable)

Target Variable:
- `Exited = 1` → Customer churned
- `Exited = 0` → Customer retained

Approximately 20% of customers in the dataset churned, creating a class imbalance problem.

## 🔍 Key Insights from EDA
- Customers in Germany show significantly higher churn rates.
- Inactive customers are substantially more likely to churn.
- Customers holding exactly 2 products have the lowest churn rate.
- Older customers display higher churn tendency.
- Higher account balances are associated with elevated churn risk.

These findings guided modeling and business recommendations.

## ⚙️ Models Implemented
Three classification models were trained and compared:
1. Logistic Regression (Baseline)
2. Random Forest
3. XGBoost (Final Model)

Class imbalance was addressed using:
- `class_weight='balanced'` in Logistic Regression

Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall (Churn)
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

## 🏆 Final Model: XGBoost
XGBoost delivered the strongest overall performance.

Performance:
- Accuracy ≈ 87%
- ROC-AUC ≈ 0.87
- Improved recall for churn detection

To improve churn capture, probability threshold was adjusted from 0.5 to 0.3, increasing recall while maintaining reasonable precision. This reflects a business-driven optimization where missing a churned customer is more costly than a false alarm.

## 📈 Feature Importance
Top drivers of churn:
- Number of Products
- Activity Status
- Age
- Geography (Germany)
- Gender

These insights provide direct guidance for retention strategies.

## 🧠 Business Recommendations
Based on model findings:
- Launch engagement campaigns targeting inactive customers.
- Prioritize churn prevention in Germany.
- Focus retention efforts on customers with only 1 product.
- Offer age-tailored financial products for customers above 40.
- Deploy probability-based targeting using optimized threshold scoring.
